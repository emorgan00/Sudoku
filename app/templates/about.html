After generating a puzzle, you will be immediately taken to the solver page with the puzzle clues already gridded for you, ready for you to begin solving. If you have your own puzzle which you would like to solve through the built-in editor, you can enter the clues in the provided grid under the Solver tab. The Solver tab also has the ability to produce the solution to a puzzle you enter. <br><br>

	<p class='choice_header'>Codes and Links</p>
	<div class='choice_box' style='width: 80vw;'>
		One of the main features of this site is the ability to generate static links for any puzzles, either generated by the computer, or created by a human. When on the puzzle display page, clicking the "Export as Code" button will generate a code and static link for the puzzle. If you ever want to show the puzzle to someone, simply copy and paste the provided link, and it will take whoever clicks it straight to the editor with your puzzle already set up and ready to solve. (The code can be used in the Solver tab to quickly fill the grid).
